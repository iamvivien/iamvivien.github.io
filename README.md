# **INTRODUCTION**
“CycleMyLyfe” is a VR-based prototype, which cyclists and Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users can use to practice safe riding in Singapore. “CycleMyLyfe” also has a secondary goal for non-cyclists to empathize with cyclists on the road. This software will be designed with realism in mind to allow users to better appreciate safe riding in Singapore.


## **HOW TO RUN**

Prior to launching the application, players are required to have a Google Cardboard to enjoy the full experience of the application.
Both the Players and the SCTF Members will see this page when they access our application. 

After selecting the "Login" button,the application will bring them to the login page. For the players accessing the application for the first time, they are required to sign up as a new member.

Here, they are required to login with their credentials to access the application. However, they only have 3 attempts to login successfully and should they fail to do so due to invalid credentials after the last attempt, all the fields will be disabled. Players will be allowed to try again after refreshing the page or they can reset their username or password by clicking on the 'forget username/password' link.


### **For Players:**

After successful authentication, the player will stumble upon the user page where they will have three options to choose from. They are "Rules & Regulations", "Tutorial" and "Select Level".

When the player selects the "Rules & Regulations" button, general rules of the application will be displayed. Also, the players are encouraged to provide feedback on their experiences in playing the application for further improvement

The player can select the "Tutorial" button to view a video demonstration on how to play the game. 

The player can select different game levels of the application via a drop-down list.

Lastly, once the player has selected the ideal game level, a "Start Game" button will become visible. The game will begin once the start button is selected. If the player wants to leave, he or she can just simply click the logout button.


### **For SCTF Members:**

Upon successful login into the SCTF page, the SCTF member will be able to view the SCTF page.

The SCTF member will be able to amend the number of vehicles and pedestrians that will appear in each level game. An option to upload a 360 degree video to represent the environment is also available. 

The environment will be updated accordingly after all changes made by the SCTF member are saved.
