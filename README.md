# **INTRODUCTION**
“CycleMyLyfe” is a VR-based application, which cyclists and Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users can use to practice safe riding in Singapore. “CycleMyLyfe” also has a secondary goal for non-cyclists to empathize with cyclists on the road. This software will be designed with realism in mind to allow users to better appreciate safe riding in Singapore.
